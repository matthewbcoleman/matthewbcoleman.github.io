				<h3>Past Experience</h3>
					<p>I am a 4th year Statistics and Data Science Student at UCSB. I have worked as a data analytics intern for UCSB's D1 baseball team, as a Research Assistant helping with the development of an R package, and as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant.</p>


				<h3>Future Work</h3>
				<p>This upcoming year, I will be participating in the Central Coast Data Science Partnership ( <a href = "https://centralcoastdatascience.org/news/all/2020/ucsb-names-first-cohort-nsf-fellows">CCDSP</a> ). As part of the first Cohort for CCDSP, I am going to get the opportunity to work with a diverse group of peers to develop the the UCSB data science curriculum, work in committes for outreach, and work on capstone projects with local companies to develop my data science knowledge</p>

				<p>In my free time, I play club roller hockey (it is a sport) for UCSB, to which we we have gone to the national championships in 2019, and were given a bid to participate in the 2020 national championship. When I am not playing roller hockey, I am either running (ex-cross-country runner) or going for mountain bike rides to get my dose of adrenaline.</p>
