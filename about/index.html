			<h1>About Me</h1>

				<h3>Past Experience</h3>
					<p>I have worked as a data analytics intern for UCSB's D1 baseball team, where I wrote player development research reports coded in R and Python. In the Spring of 2020, I was Research Assistant helping Professor Alexander Petersen with the development of his R package, WRI, which focuses on the estimation of conditional mean densities. As a research assistant, I helped with the formula interface, package documentation, and creation of the package vignette. At the same time, I wasan Undergraduate Learning Assistant, where I held individual drop-in office hours and helped teaching assistants during computer lab sections.</p>

				<h3>Current Work</h3>
					<p>I am currently a Data Science Intern at <a href="https://www.bigiron.com/AboutUs">BigIron Auctions</a> where I build company dashboards for visualization of customer behavior and assist with the development of models to determine likely buyers of equipment. I am also working as the Transfer Peer Advisor for the Statistics depatment at UCSB, where I assist 135 incoming transfer students with admission steps, course clearance, and schedule planning.</p>


				<h3>Future Work</h3>
				<p>This upcoming year, I will be participating in the Central Coast Data Science Partnership ( <a href = "https://centralcoastdatascience.org/news/all/2020/ucsb-names-first-cohort-nsf-fellows">CCDSP</a> ). As part of the first Cohort for CCDSP, I am going to get the opportunity to work with a diverse group of peers to develop the the UCSB data science curriculum, work in committes for outreach, and work on capstone projects with local companies to develop my data science knowledge</p>

				<p>In my free time, I play club roller hockey (it is a sport) for UCSB, to which we we have gone to the national championships in 2019, and were given a bid to participate in the 2020 national championship. When I am not playing roller hockey, I am either running (ex-cross-country runner) or going for mountain bike rides to get my dose of adrenaline.</p>
