In the summer of 2020, I took a course, Geography 176A - *Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Science* - Where I was able to apply my knowledge in R in the realm of spatial data. Highlights from the course include:


## [Building a Project Website](https://matthewbcoleman.github.io/)

- In this lab I built a webpage using only Rmarkdown and the resulting .html files from the knitting.
- Learned how to use different types of YAML commands.
- Learned how to create a navbar (super useful) to navigate between my different pages.

## [Exploring COVID-19 Trends](https://matthewbcoleman.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- In this lab I conducted an investigation into COVID-19 case trends.
- Learned how to create faceted plot to show trends by group.
- Learned the beginnings of mapping in R with ggplot. 

## [Distances and Projections](https://matthewbcoleman.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)
- Analysis and mapping of cities based on different criteria including distance to US, state, MX, and CA border.
- Learned how to map in ggplot using `geom_sf`
- Learned how to highlight features of interest using `gghighlight` and label points neatly with `ggrepel`
